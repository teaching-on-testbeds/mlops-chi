    "-   The process of provisioning and deploying the infrastructure is scalable, because it is heavily automated. It is easy to rebuild the system, without requiring effort or expertise.\n",

    "-   [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), which we’ll use to provision the resources on our cloud infrastructure provider. (A popular alternative is [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/).)\n",
    "-   [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible), which we’ll use to configure and deploy Kubernetes, and then to set up the Kubernetes cluster and the services running on it. (A popular alternative is [Salt](https://github.com/saltstack/salt).)\n",
